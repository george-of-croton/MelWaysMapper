##Melways Map Generator

#A webservice I developed for my employer to automatically generate and save maps from Melways.com

The app uses the webshot API to provide functionality similar to google maps static maps, where a user can provide an address or coordinates and receive an image of the map. The app overcomes the problem of saving melways map which are provided as a series of small .png tiles, not a single image.
